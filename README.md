Feature representation and classification are two
key steps for face recognition. We compared three
automated methods for face recognition using different
method for feature extraction: PCA (Principle Component
Analysis), LDA (Linear Discriminate Analysis), ICA
(Independent Component Analysis) and SVM (Support
Vector Machine) were used for classification. The
experiments were implemented on two face databases, The
ATT Face Database [1] and the Indian Face Database (IFD)
[2] with the combination of methods (PCA+ SVM),
(ICA+SVM) and (LDA+SVM) showed that (LDA+SVM)
method had a higher recognition rate than the other two
methods for face recognition.
